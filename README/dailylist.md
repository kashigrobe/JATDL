Page Initialization and Event Handling

## When the page loads, event listeners should be set up for task management functionalities.
- The page should fetch and display existing tasks for the logged-in user.
Task Fetching and Display

## The application should asynchronously fetch tasks associated with the user's email and display them in a table.
- Each task should show details like ID, title, description, due date, and completion status.

## 
Task Creation

The user can create a new task by entering details like title, description, and due date.
After submission, the new task should be sent to the server, added to the database, and displayed in the task list.

## Task Completion Toggle

Each task should have a button to toggle its completion status.
On click, the task's completion status should update in the database and reflect on the UI.

## Task Deletion

Users should be able to delete tasks. A confirmation prompt should appear before deletion.
Upon confirmation, the task should be removed from the database and the UI should be updated.
Dynamic User Email Integration

- The application should handle tasks based on the user's dynamic email, not hardcoded values.
Error Handling

The application should handle errors in fetching, updating, and deleting tasks, providing relevant feedback to the user.
User Registration

Users should be able to register their email to receive notifications about due dates.. Later on, not at this stage
